# [2<sup>2048</sup>](../) - What's new!
## 1.21 Update - Theme Switcher!
Just one simple thing with this update, a theme switcher! Keep it on auto for seasonal themes, plain for a plain experience, and the rest should be apparent.
## 1.20 Update - The Halloween Update!
No real halloween upgrades, sorry. But on the bright side, this exists now! We now also have a UNO upgrade.
